# LibGDX Steering Behaviors Demo

A very simple playground I wrote to help me better grok how LibGDXs [Steering Behaviors](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki/Steering-Behaviors) work. This utilizes Box2D physics bodies (a combination of dynamic and static) to simulate a based game scenario, where an agent is moving around a 2D world (from a top down perspective). All Steering Behaviors have been implemented, as well as a Priority behavior (combining obstacle avoidance and Seeking). This is just a demo, do not take it as best practice.

### Prerequisites

Latest LibGDX
